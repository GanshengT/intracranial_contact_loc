This repository includes algorithms in MATLAB for localizing intracranial contact. CT images, MRI images, and freesurfer software are required.

Updates:
2025 Aug 19, I developed an automated pipeline for estimating intracranial electrode location based on CT images and manufacture information of the electrode lead. The main script has been tested on DIXI electrodes.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GanshengT/intracranial_contact_loc.git
cd intracranial_contact_loc
```
