This repository includes algorithms in MATLAB for localizing intracranial contact. CT images, MRI images, and freesurfer software are required.

Updates:
2025 Aug 19, I developed an automated pipeline for estimating intracranial electrode location based on CT images and manufacture information of the electrode lead. The main script has been tested on DIXI electrodes.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GanshengT/intracranial_contact_loc.git
cd intracranial_contact_loc
```

## Motivation and objective
**Electrode localization** refers to identifying the precise anatomical positions of implanted intracranial electrodes.  
This step is essential in both **clinical practice** and **neuroscience research**:

- **Clinical applications**:  
  - Mapping eloquent cortex for surgical planning.  
  - Delineating seizure onset zones in patients with epilepsy.  
  - Guiding resection or stimulation strategies with minimal risk.  

- **Research applications**:  
  - Linking electrophysiological signals to anatomical structures.  
  - Understanding network-level dynamics of cognition and disease.  
  - Enabling reproducible and anatomically grounded scientific discovery.

Precise and **objective localization** is thus critical. However, most workflows still rely heavily on **manual localization**, which presents two major limitations:  

1. **Subjectivity** – human raters must distinguish contacts on CT scans that often suffer from streak artifacts and noisy intensity. For example, an isosurface in FreeSurfer may appear as a continuous lead, making individual contacts ambiguous.  
2. **Time-consuming and error-prone** – manual tracing and labeling are labor-intensive, and mistakes can propagate through analysis pipelines.  

To address these issues, **v1.0** of this pipeline introduced an automated approach that leverages CT intensity and a connected-graph searching algorithm to identify electrode contacts.  

Building on this foundation, **v2.0** incorporates **electrode manufacturing specifications** to further improve robustness. By exploiting the known geometry of linear electrode leads, the algorithm can fit multiple contacts simultaneously, mitigating the impact of noisy voxels and imaging artifacts. This allows faster, more accurate, and reproducible electrode localization for both clinical and research use cases.

## Methods
### step 1: metal identification
Our automated electrode localization approach begins by analyzing the CT intensity distribution.  
We identify peaks corresponding to metal contacts, which allows us to select candidate voxels associated with the electrode lead.

### step 2-1: lead identification
We visualize the **metal voxel isosurface** to sanity-check the threshold and the spatial distribution of metal (contacts + lead body). We also overlay the **planned trajectory** (exported from ROSA) and restrict analysis to voxels that lie within a **cylindrical neighborhood** of this line segment. This (i) suppresses unrelated metal (e.g., screws/plates) and (ii) disambiguates adjacent leads.

**Note on ROSA coordinates:** Ensure the ROSA trajectory is in **the same RAS frame** as the CT used for localization. Co registration is needed

### step 2-2: seed growing algorithm for lead identification

</p>
*Figure: metal voxels within the cyliner around the planned trajctory*  

From the set of metal voxels near the planned trajectory, we employed a seed-growing algorithm to isolate the voxels corresponding to the intended lead. The main objective is to disambiguate this lead from neighboring electrodes or unrelated metal.

To achieve this, multiple seeds are initialized within the metal cluster, and each seed iteratively expands its voxel pool. At each step, a neighboring voxel is added if it lies close to the centroid of the current pool, thereby maintaining a coherent and compact structure.

To prevent growth onto adjacent leads, we evaluate the filling ratio of a cylindrical tube aligned with the planned trajectory and encompassing the current voxel pool. Because different leads typically have offsets or angular deviations relative to the planned path, including voxels from another lead would substantially reduce the cylinder’s filling ratio. This provides a natural safeguard against erroneous extension across multiple leads.

Furthermore, we identify the proximal entry point and the most distal point based on segmenting the brain from the CT. We checked the interception between the identified lead voxel and the brain mask and check which direction (between the two end points, that is, the interception point and the distal point) align with the boundary to center vectors from the brain mask.

### step 3: modeling lead as a linear or bezier function

</p>
*Figure: example of roc curve, the curve shows how many voxels is included if increase the radius of a tube along a linear line or a bezier function. A negative BIC change from linear Bezier will suggest bending during the lead implentation. For 99% lead implented in WashU, the lead is straight and can be modelled with a linear function.

### step 4: electrode localization

After modeling the lead, we calculate electrode likelihood along the modelled line/curve. An electrode can be modelled by a cylinder with radius and length. For each location, we subtract the background (outter shell) CT intensity from the elecrtode cylinder intensity as the electrode likelihood.

Most of the time, the lead is presented as segmented line in the CT images, where electrodes are separated. Below is an example of a typical lead in CT images.
