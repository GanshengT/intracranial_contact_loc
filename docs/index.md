Welcome to the documentation. Use the navigation for tutorials and examples. This repository includes algorithms in MATLAB for localizing intracranial contact. CT images, elecrtode information (OR sheet) and freesurfer software are required. MRI images are optional and for later coregistration and brain segmentation, and elecrtode labeling.

- [API Reference](api.md)
API is under reorganization. Examples are currently included in the tutorials.

Updates:
2025 Aug 19, I developed an automated pipeline for estimating intracranial electrode location based on CT images and manufacture information of the electrode lead. The main script has been tested on DIXI electrodes.
